    <div class="iago" id="iago">Although Shakespeare produced Othello and many of his other works over 400 years ago, their themes, especially those of how appearances can mislead, remain relevant. Throughout Othello, Shakespeare provides many examples of these misleading appearances, most of which include Iago and his clever manipulation and deception. A prime example of this is when Iago advises Cassio, although his true intentions are to use him as a tool to manipulate Othello. This is clearly seen when Iago advises Cassio to ask for Desdemona’s aid, stating ”Our general’s wife is now the general… Confess yourself freely to her, importune her help to put you in"(II,III,318-322)  but then says "So will I turn her virtue into pitch And out of her own goodness make the net That shall enmesh them all."(II,III,363-365). Here, Iago seems to be helping Cassio by advising him to speak to Desdemona, but later reveals his true intentions to use her kindness to manipulate Othello. This demonstrates how, even when people appear well intentioned and helpful, their true motives can be manipulative and harmful. Although Othello was written centuries ago, its lessons remain relevant. Othello teaches the audience to be cautious of who they decide to trust and to look past appearances. Therefore, Othello and many of his other works are relevant even in today’s world.</div>
